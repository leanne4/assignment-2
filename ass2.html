    <h2>A nugget of info about me</h2>
    <p>Hey there, I’m Leanne. I was born in California, raised along the west coast of the USA, and relocated 7 years ago to Ontario only to bounce over to the Canadian west coast after many years of longing to be back. I have a mini zoo of pets at home and spend far too much time playing video games or watching horror movies. </p>
    <h3>Some of my pets &#9825;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An Iguana named <i>Chunk</i></li>
        <li>A Monitor named <strong>Beans</strong></li>
        <li>A parrot named <i>Tango</i></li>
        <li>A Corgi named <strong>Ein</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Activity online</h2>
    <p>I’ve been active on forums and online games since about 2003. Slowly but surely branched my way into website maintenance despite my young age. I learned primarily HTML but ended up needing to use Java as well. It’s sadly been over 10 years since I’ve coded much of anything so I might as well be learning from scratch. </p>

    <h2>What I hope to gain from this class</h2>
    <p>Ultimately my goal is to not only refresh but advance my knowledge from way back when that I had in HTML as well as CSS.</p>
